# Publinker

**Publinker** ~~is~~ _will be_ a simple URL shortener, meant for small-scale deployment. Just about everything other than this core mission statement is still very much subject to change, so use at your own risk.

It currently already _works_, but its fitness for public consumption is quite suspect, resulting in this lack of instructions and just about everything else, really. More to come, obviously.
